workflow for git

Problem: Jupyter notebook outputs have large images which cannot be uploaded to github
Current solution Tobi: Have local branch 'Tobi_local' that commits images in output, but strip image outputs without before committing them to Tobi branch that can be uploaded to github.
Current solution Elena: Convert jupyter notebooks to .py files and only sync .py files to Github. Ignore .ipynb files.

Git workflow idea with Elena:I have jupyter notebook files with images in it in my tobi_local branch

When i want to commit to the online version i want to first strip the pictures away for that i do
generate a new branch stripped_temp
in this branch i use the command
find . -name "*.ipynb" | xargs nbstripout  
then i want to only merge this last command to the tobi branch
for that i need to figure out how to do this. maybe with merge —squash?
then i only have the stripped version on the tobi branch online. while i remain to have the pictures in tobi_local.

###Terminal commands###
git checkout -b Tobi_stripped_temp
find . -name "*.ipynb" | xargs nbstripout
git commit -am "Temporary clean version for push"
git checkout Tobi
git merge --squash Tobi_stripped_temp
git branch -D Tobi_stripped_temp
git checkout Tobi_local
